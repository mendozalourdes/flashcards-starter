## Overview and Project Goals
The [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/flash-cards.html) of this group project that was made for Module  2 at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) is to build an object-oriented application and testing suite using TDD.

## Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
1. Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
2. Implement ES6 classes
3. Contribute code to an partially constructed object-oriented application
4. Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
5. Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

2. `cd` into the repository in your terminal.
3. Then run `node index.js` in your terminal to begin the game within your terminal.

## How does this work?

## Project Reflection

##### Wins
* Being able to work through the game's logic, and ensure that all classes are connecting and working together.

##### Challenges
* Writing the test before the code implementation took extra effort.

#### Future Features
* Ability to review incorrect answers after the game has been played through the first time.
